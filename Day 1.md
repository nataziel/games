I arrived today in [[San Sibilia]], having caught the overnight ferry from from the imperial capital. For a city so close to the centre of the empire, so close to the insatiable maw that was even now devouring territory it had little need for, it had a strange way of seeming to resist the cultural hegemony that quickly seemed to overtake other territories that resisted annexation.

Some regions resisted direct imperial control, perhaps through geographical luck, like Bawat, whose mountainous terrain defied every ambitious imperial general that chanced their careers on a tilt at the windmill city, or even geographical un-luck in the case of Pinot; some resisted the cultural exports that flowed like something half way between a burst dam and spilt blood, creeping under doors and such. Very few did both.

Of course, [[San Sibilia]] has always been there, even been a decently important trading partner. It stayed independent long after the surrounding territories fell under the sway of the empire, but it seemed like emperor after emperor had no taste for conquering this little morsel, no matter how immense their appetite for expansion was in other directions.

It was the place that people went to disappear. Rumour had it that [[Emperor Tarkin]] himself retired to an estate just a few miles from the city, or was it a walled compound in the dockside neighbourhood of [[Saltspray]]? Little matter I guess, he was 75 at the time of his abdication so it's unlikely he's still breathing the sandalwood scented air of the city and it's surrounds.
