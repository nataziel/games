a military focused matrix game

The communities of an isolated valley, enveloped by an empire but never truly "pacified" defy their local lord who has imposed harsh taxation. The communities govern themselves and refuse to bow to a religious order who claim dominion over the land. The religious order have been unable to force the peasants to kneel, and have called in support from the empire to crush the self governing communities, lest other local towns and valleys decide they too can look after themselves.
